      A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object,
      such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to
      escape from a magma chamber below the surface.

  <h2>Why do Volcanoes Occur?</h2>
    <p>
      Earth's volcanoes occur because its crust is broken into 17 major,
      rigid tectonic plates that float on a hotter, softer layer in its
      mantle. Therefore, on Earth, volcanoes are generally found where
      tectonic plates are diverging or converging, and most are found
      underwater. Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and
      thinning of the crust's plates, e.g., in the East African Rift and
      the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field.
